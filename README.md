# MyProject

## Overview

**MyProject** is an Android application designed using modern development practices including Kotlin DSL for build scripts, Clean Architecture, MVVM pattern, Paging Library, Kotlin Flow, and Coroutines. This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, maintainable, and testable Android application.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture separates the project into different layers, each with its own responsibility:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Handles data management from various sources (e.g., remote, local databases).
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI-related code, including ViewModels.
- **DI (Dependency Injection)**: Hilt is used to manage dependencies.

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

The MVVM pattern is used to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way:

- **Model**: Represents data and business logic.
- **View**: The UI layer that displays data and sends user actions to the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and communicates with the Model layer.

### Technologies Used

- **Kotlin DSL**: Used for the Gradle build scripts, providing a more idiomatic and type-safe way to configure builds.
- **Paging Library**: Helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Kotlin Flow**: Used for handling streams of data asynchronously, providing a more powerful way to handle reactive programming.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Used to manage background threads, providing a simple and efficient way to handle asynchronous programming.

### Features

- **Paged List**: Efficiently display large sets of data with the Paging Library.
- **Reactive Data Handling**: Use Kotlin Flow for reactive programming.
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Hilt for managing dependencies.
- **Modern Kotlin**: Leverage the latest Kotlin features and libraries.
